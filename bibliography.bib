There are 10 members of the voltage-gated calcium channel family that have been characterized in mammals, and they serve distinct roles in cellular signal transduction. This article presents the molecular relationships and physiological functions of these calcium channel proteins and provides comprehensive information on their molecular, genetic, physiological, and pharmacological properties.},
