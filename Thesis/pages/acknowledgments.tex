I would like to thank the preliminary readers of this thesis, especially my mother Dietlind, for their efforts and valuable feedback.
Without you, this thesis would contain a heap of errors, and the style would be bleak.
I would also like to extend my gratitude to my supervisor Zhuangyi Jiang
, who helped me stay on track and had useful insights when they were necessary.
Finally, I am grateful to my parents and grandparents for supporting me my whole life.
